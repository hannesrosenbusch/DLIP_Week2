# Carry out the exercises in your own copy of the notebook that you can find at
#    https://www.kaggle.com/code/datasniffer/perceptrons-mlp-s-and-gradient-descent.
# Then copy and paste code asked for below in between the dashed lines.
# Do not import additional packages.

# Task 1: 
# Instructions:
# In the notebook, you wrote a function that implements an MLP with 2 hidden layers.
# The function should accept a vector of weights and a matrix X that stores input feature 
# vectors in its **columns**.
# The name of the function should be my_mlp.

# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def my_mlp:
    pass  # replace with implementation

# -----------------------------------------------

# Task 2: 
# Instructions:
# In the notebook, you wrote a function that implements a loss function for training
# the MLP implemented by my_mlp of Task 1.
# The function should accept a vector of weights, a matrix X that stores input feature 
# vectors in its **columns**, and a vector y that stores the target labels (-1 or +1).
# The name of the function should be MSE_func.

# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def MSE_func:
    pass  # replace with implementation

# -----------------------------------------------

# Task 3: 
# Instructions:
# In the notebook, you wrote a function that returns the gradient vector for the least
# squares (simple) linear regression loss function.
# The function should accept a vector beta that contains the intercept (β₀) and the slope (β₁), 
# a vector x that stores values of the independent variable, and a vector y that stores
# the values of the dependent variable and should return an np.array() that has the derivative values 
# as its components.
# The name of the function should be dR.

# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def dR:
    pass  # replace with implementation

# -----------------------------------------------
